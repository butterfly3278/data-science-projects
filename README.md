## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. 📉 Churn Prediction – ChurnX Telecom

**Industry:** Telecom  
**Business Problem:**  
ChurnX Telecom noticed customer drop-offs and wanted to predict which customers were likely to cancel their services.

**Solution:**  
I built a classification model using historical customer data to predict churn. This included:

- Data cleaning and encoding
- Logistic Regression modeling
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall
- Insights for customer retention strategies

### 2. 🧠 Customer Segmentation – MarketBoost

**Industry:** Marketing Analytics  
**Business Problem:**  
MarketBoost needed to segment its customer base to design better targeted campaigns and improve marketing ROI.

**Solution:**  
I used unsupervised learning (KMeans Clustering) to segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Clustering analysis
- Visualizations to compare segments
- Strategic recommendations for each customer group
